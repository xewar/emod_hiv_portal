# EMOD-HIV Portal

This project creates a web portal for accessing EMOD-HIV country files and is a collaboration with the research laboratory of Dr. Anna Bershteyn at NYU's Department of Population Health. 

## Server instructions

To view locally, set the development server. You can also see an initial prototype [here](https://emod-hiv-portal.vercel.app/).

### Installation

The easiest way to get the development server running is with `npm`. Steps are:

1. If you haven't already, install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). On Ubuntu, this can be done via `sudo snap install node` (warning: do not use `apt install`, it's too old!).
2. In a new terminal, install dependencies: `npm install`

### Running

You can run the server with `npm`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site.
